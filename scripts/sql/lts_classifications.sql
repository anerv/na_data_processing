-- class 1 - dedicated, protected cycling infra
-- class 2 - unprotected cycling infra

-- class 4 - ...

-- CLASSIFY EDGES BASED ON THEIR NODES
    -- WHAT TYPE OF INTERSECTION DO THEY CONNECT TO
    -- WHAT CLASS OF STREET DO THEY CONNECT TO




-- Classify nodes based on what type of edges they connect to
-- If a node is connected to a high-stress street and it is unregulated: 
--> all edges connnected to that node is assigned the higher stress? Or they are somehow changed so the intersection cannot be used/introduces a 'missing link'
